1. Encoding the Message 
The encode_message function takes your 3-bit message and uses the generator matrix G to create a longer 6-bit codeword. The additional bits help later on to find and fix errors.  
Think of it like this:  
message → add protection bits → codeword

2. Introducing an Error 
The introduce_error function changes one random bit in the codeword. This simulates a real error that might happen when sending the message.

3. Detecting the Error
The calculate_syndrome function uses the parity-check matrix H. If the received codeword has no errors, the syndrome will show all zeros. If the syndrome has any non-zero values, it means there is an error.

4. Correcting the Error
The correct_error function looks at the syndrome and compares it to the columns of H. Each column shows what the syndrome looks like for an error in a specific bit position. If the syndrome matches a column, we know which bit is wrong and can fix it by flipping it back.  
After correcting the codeword, the program checks if it matches the original codeword. If it does, the program has successfully fixed the error.
