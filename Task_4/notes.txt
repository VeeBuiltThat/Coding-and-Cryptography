1. Generating and Saving a Key
A new Fernet key is created using Fernet.generate_key().
The key is saved into a file called mykey.key.
This key is required for both encryption and decryption.

2. Encrypting a File
The program loads the key from mykey.key.
It opens a file called my_details.txt and reads its original contents.
Using the Fernet key, the contents are encrypted.
The encrypted data is written back into my_details.txt, replacing the original text.

3. Decrypting the File
The program loads the same key from mykey.key.
It opens my_details.txt, which now contains encrypted data.
The data is decrypted back to its original form.
The decrypted data is saved back into my_details.txt.
